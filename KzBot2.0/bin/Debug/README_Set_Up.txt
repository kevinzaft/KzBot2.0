EDIT: ONLY WORKS WITH WIDESCREEN MONITORS RN (16:9) RATIO. Working on fix for non-widescreen things
	-Implimented All resolution(16:9) fix. Need more testing. Recommened to stay with 1280x720.

NEW: added config file (KzBot2.exe.config) so users can customize stuff (change the "value" in the "key"s to what you want)

1) Must be using NOX on 1280x720 resolution on Windows
	-Sometimes NOX doesnt actually use 1280x720 even if you select it and click apply. If this is the case, 
	apply a different res and change it back to 1280x720 
	-I also recommend selecting "Fixed Window Size" in interface settings just in case
2) Know what "Corpse Dragging" is
3) Enter 4-3E and zoom out ALL THE WAY
4) You will be dragging using the first 2 units in either AR or RF category (MG not tested)
5) If you are doing an "Odd" # of runs your dragger in the very first slot (of the selected gun type) must be full ammo+food. Vise versa for "Even" # runs.
6) Echelon 1 is used as resupply
7) Echelon 2 is the team you're leveling
8) In Echelon 2, the dragger will go in the RIGHT MOST SLOT

-The script will handel repairing and resupply and restarting any expeditions
-If you're draggers clear the stage 2 slow PM me so I can increase the delay
-Stop the script by pressing "Abort"
-Don't Modify the ______Default.jpg files
-If you have a potato or bad internet speed, then rip. PM me and maybe i'll impliment custom offsets

-To reset formationButtonDefault.jpg and/or repairButtonDefault.jpg because you changed the resolution or something,
 click the Formation/Repair buttons under the "Screenshots Reset" headder.
